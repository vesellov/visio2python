.. module:: automat

This is the base class for State Machine.
The BitDust project is developing in principles of 
`Automata-based programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata-based_programming>`_.

This is a programming paradigm in which the program or its part is thought of as a model of a 
`finite state machine <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_machine>`_ or any other formal automaton.   

Its defining characteristic is the use of finite state machines to 
`describe program behavior <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram>`_.
      
The transition graphs of state machines are used in all stages of software development: 
- specification, 
- implementation, 
- debugging and 
- documentation.

You can see Transition graph for all BitDust state machines in the file  
`automats.pdf <http://bitdust.io/automats.pdf>`_, 
MS Visio, 'editable' version:
`automats.vsd <http://bitdust.io/automats.vsd>`_, 
stencils is here: `automats.vss <http://bitdust.io/automats.vss>`_

A small tool called `visio2python <http://code.google.com/p/visio2python/>`_ 
was written to simplify working with the BitDust project. 

It can translate transition graphs created in Microsoft Visio into Python code.

Automata-Based Programming technology was introduced by Anatoly Shalyto in 1991 and Switch-technology was 
developed to support automata-based programming.
Automata-Based Programming is considered to be rather general purpose program development methodology 
than just another one finite state machine implementation.
Anatoly Shalyto is the former of 
`Foundation for Open Project Documentation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Open_Project_Documentation>`_.
